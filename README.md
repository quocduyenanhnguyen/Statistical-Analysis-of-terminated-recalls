# Description: 
- In this project, I was in charge of writing codes to analyze food recalls dataset extracted from the FDA website by conducting exploratory data analysis and hypothesis test of two population proportions to determine if the year 2021 has less percentage of terminated food recalls than the previous year. If it does, then it means that the FDA has done a good job at implementing food recalls regulations and the manufacturers have made efforts to correct their violated products, which resulted in fewer cases of food recalls and hence, fewer cases of terminated food recalls. I was also in charge of formatting the written report, delegating tasks to finalize the report, and helping my teammates analyze the dataset. 

- The CSV file named recallsEDA was made to convert yes/no variables into dummry variables (0 and 1) in order to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), the CSV file recallsEDApie was also made to create a pie chart for EDA.
